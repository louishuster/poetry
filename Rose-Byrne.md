# Rose Byrne
### Louis Huster

I write when I can and I write when I want  
Which is not very often, yes not very often  
But boy when I write is it fun to sit down  
Or stand up and puke out all the love in my heart.

Rose Byrne floats around like a ghost in a jar  
Which is pretty up close, which is pretty afar  
And I like what she does and I like how she does it  
Rose Byrne is a person,  
Rose Byrne is a man.  
Rose Byrne is a woman,  
A cast iron pan.  
Rose Byrne is a flame in the night on a wing,  
Rose Byrne lifts us up to find songs.  
Rose Byrne creeps around in the woods on a frog,  
Rose Byrne’s growing tired of this.

I write what I will and I wrote what I won’t  
Which can happen a lot and can happen a lot  
And so now that that’s said that’s one thing to say less,  
I’m just do-ing my bes I’m just do-ing my bes.
