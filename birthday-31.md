# Birthday 31
### Louis Huster

Dear me,

I want to cry and I’m tired but I had a good day.  
I went to the cemetery,  
I made love.  
\[list not in order\]

We walked and walked and walked  
And walked.

I don’t think my fellow actors liked me very much. I’m probably wrong but I don’t *feel* like I’m wrong.  
Our lead wrote us all an individualized note on postcards from the Globe theater and I, for the first time since valentine’s day in elementary school when you had to make *one* for *everyone*, was offended by the genericness of the message he wrote me.

“Dear \[person\],  
It was a pleasure to do \[insert activity\] with you\!”

After our final show we all went down to a brasserie to have drinks and food with the whole cast and I was sat at one end (of the very table-snake-monster thing that filled three quarters of the whole restaurant and made one of the servers cry) with the message-writer and his leading lady.  
I told them they were really great and then said it again later and really meant it because I really did think they had properly worked their roles and had very good technique. Neither of them paid me back a compliment (no that’s *not* why I paid them theirs) so naturally I want to end my life. 

I don’t think I’m the best or anything but I figured my work was worth a compliment.

Luckily. LUCKILY. Luckily there was Dave. Wonderful Dave. He I shall name for he is deserving, DAVE, Dave, mighty Dave.  
Dave told me some of his friends thought I did really well. I told him that the rest of his friends can go fuck themselves. He laughed, I laughed, and I told him (and really meant it) that it was a pleasure to have worked with him and that I thought he’d really embodied his role and made it live. And I do mean it and did and will the next time I say it, I really enjoyed watching him and playing with him.  
Thank you Dave.

Yesterday I needed a Dave and I didn’t know it.  
Today I need a Dave too, but he’s with his family or something and I didn’t invite him to hang out with me because I didn’t know I needed a Dave and also we aren’t really friends (yet?) and I hate celebrating my birthday.

Another bravo to the leading man and woman, they were very, very good.  

Love,

Me

P.S.

What do you call it when you’re so tired you want to cry but too tired to want to cry?
