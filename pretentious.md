# Sonnet for the intellectual

### Louis Huster

In shambles I am, this one fact remains  
Although it would seem otherwise, it’s true.   
Mysterious and seemingly in chains,  
Perennially anguished, pains accrue,  
Remind me, what am I still doing here?   
Eternity ends there, at five o’clock  
Time, always ravenous and so austere  
Existence meaningless, a load of crock  
N  
T  
I  
O  
U  
S
