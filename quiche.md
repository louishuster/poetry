# Quiche

The divinity of quiche is seldom mentioned  
But,  
For benedictine eggs we will grovel,  
For truffles we will go ham,  
For that white whale caviar we will literally kill.  
And for why?   
A bit of thick yellow emulsion over an unfertilized embryo?  
A chunk of musky rot from the ground?  
The worst tapioca balls you’ve ever had?  
So quiche, dear sister, quiche  
That is what I say gives us grace.  
Quiche from beginning to end, from darkness to light and back.  
Can it save us?  
Maybe…  
What mysteries will be unraveled at the breaking of the crust?  
Quite unambiguously, it’s cheese, ham, eggs.  
That’s all there is and there is all that.  
Don’t read into it, taste it,  
Let your buds see the light and give your soul respite.
