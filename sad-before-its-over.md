# Sad before it's over

I’m already sad that this day’s going to end

Even though it just started, let me live it again!

It’s the morning, I’m sleepy, I just got to know it

But I’m sure it’s the best, there’s no way I can blow it!

This day, it was waiting for me to arrive, it was there,

Now it’s here, it’s for me, I’m alive and I feel it a hundred percent, there’s her  scent on the pillow, there’s her on it too,

It’s the morning I’m mourning this morning with you,

And I know that I shouldn’t, that I should be here,

And I am but I wouldn’t be true to my ear to my heart to my soul if I didn’t express, say out loud, this most minor distress:

That I already miss it,

It’s already gone, that I want to repeat it anon, anon,

Again and again,

Ten thousand repeats and then times that by ten and then we just might meet

My bare minimum, lowest of times I’ll accept that I get to be here in this day in this net in the sea that entangled you, fish and crabs, seaweed and me,

And it’s moving us somewhere and stirring the sand on the bottom but I’ve got your “main” in my hand,

And the color is perfectly sunny and blue and I’m breathing, like dreaming I always could too

Without thinking or testing to see if I should I just knew it, and threw it, that caution to wind:

You, my Eve in the morning right after we sinned,

Me, yours too we did one thing together and winged it was soft and a secret I’m keeping the rest,

But that’s why I’m so sad, yes this day is the best

And it was and it will be but it’ll stay here

In my heart, next to you, in my bed, just one tear,

I’m just grieving this briefly, I can’t let it pass

Without saying goodbye one last time, just one last!
