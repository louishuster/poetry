# Sadness and Smoking

### Louis Huster

“I only smoke cigarettes when I’m sad”  
She said  
“How often are you sad?”  
“Every day…  
I don’t cry though, it’s strange.  
I forgot how to cry, I think…  
It feels weird to cry alone. I get embarrassed. I feel like crying should be for someone.  
Most people get embarrassed when they *do* cry in front of someone. Right?”  
   
“So when you’re sad, you smoke instead of crying?”  
“I guess so”
