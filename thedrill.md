# The Drill

Jake stared in no particular direction, although his attention’s focal point fell on the C-1300 DeWalt Extra Long Life power drill. He couldn’t let it see him looking. He was better than that

A woman who might be called handsome stopped near the tool, rifling through different drill batteries. She wore a long overcoat made of a felt-like material, khaki colored with what seemed to be a regular amount of buttons and pockets. Her hair was cut so that a strong, tanned neck connected head to coat collar unobstructed. As she scanned the shelf left to right, all the muscles in her neck flexed in a similar left to right fashion. The skin creased and curved with the movement of the muscles. It reminded Jake of a tightly drawn sail in a strong wind, each crease originating from where the sail’s corner and boom connect; or in the woman’s case, the nape of her neck.

This woman’s presence was a blessing, it might just be enough. The drill was probably a jealous type. Now that there was some competition for Jake’s attention, the ground evened out under his feet, legs now relaxed. Of course in reality there was no competition. A Keira Knightley-type could’ve stripped right there on the checkered orange and white linoleum tiles but Jake only would’ve been upset when the inevitable crowd this drew blocked his view of the drill. 

Apparently finding what she wanted, the handsome woman with a sail-neck continued down the aisle and turned at the end, out of sight now. Once again Jake and the drill were left alone. He pretended to interest himself in a small section of the aisle dedicated to manual screwdrivers, picking up a philips head, turning it in his hands. Disinterestedly he slotted it back onto the hook where it hung and wobbled unsteadily. 

Jake noticed his hands were clammy. ‘Great’, he thought, ‘I’m going to hold the drill with clammy hands, what could possibly go wrong? Everyone *loves* clammy hands.’ Putting them in his pockets didn’t help, the moisture welcomed small pieces of lint and strands of hair to cling onto his fingers and palms.

‘It’s now or never’

He turned to face it. Colored a soft emerald-turquoise, the slender, curved body begged to be caressed. The trigger, nestled intimately into the composite plastic body screamed to be squeezed. The battery’s velvet finish reminded him of the pillows on which sit crowns. Cumbersome crowns with blindingly bright precious metal, obnoxiously decadent gems and stones. Instead, the sleek handle of that same emerald-turquoise color almost melted into the battery. Marble grey rubber grip wrapped itself around like an Egyptian baby might be wrapped in mother’s silk shawl. It would be criminal for its first hand to be clammy and lint-infested. ‘No, I can’t do this.’ Jake wrenched his eyes away, turned and took three of the heaviest steps. ‘Be a MAN\! Make something of your life\!’

Overhead, a staticky voice, ‘we’ll be closing in five minutes, please grab your last item and proceed to the registers.’  
The announcement echoed through the aisle before silence enveloped it once more. The voice rang in Jake’s ears, almost unbelievably painful. It reminded him to check his pockets, however, he would need to pay for the drill.

No wallet. The icy panic which took hold intensified the ringing in his ears and the word ‘registers’ repeated itself over and over. Dizzy with nausea, numb, ears about to burst with the ringing, Jake stumbled sideways, knocking down the poorly placed screwdriver he had feigned to inspect. The heavy clunk as it hit the floor, followed by the tap tap of the plastic casing meeting the linoleum overwhelmed him.

His vision encircled by black and white dots, Jake no longer knew where he was. The dots, breathing in and out, expanding and contracting, crept their way to the center of his vision. This was it. Before darkness consumed his world and himself, Jake, disoriented, found the drill. The small circle of vision he had left set a stage-light on the drill. Darkness enclosed, emerald-turquoise was the last thing he saw.
